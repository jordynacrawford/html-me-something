                    <h2 class="text">Ancient Brewing</h2>
                    <p class="text">Women’s involvement in brewing beer has been documented to at least four-thousand years ago in Mesopotamia, and likely much earlier. Ancient Sumerians even had a goddess of beer, Ninkasi. And a female divine being in Ainu mythology known as Kamui Fuchi was the protector of brewing. Brewers prayed to her and offered libations to ensure the warding off of evil spirits which might spoil the batch. Ethnographic and archaeological studies have shown that brewing was an outcropping of gathering or baking traditions, which were predominantly women's roles throughout the world.</p>

                    <h2 class="text">Colonial America</h2>
                    <p class="text">Fast forward to colonial America. The craft of brewing beer was brought over from Europe, and women resumed their roles in society as tavernkeepers and brewers. But tavernkeepers were not the only women brewing; housewives were as well, and brewing beer was one of the many tasks on their long list of daily duties. Beer was consumed more than water at this time, and one needed to have a steady supply of the beverage on hand. In 1734, Mary Lisle become America’s unofficial first brewster when she took over her father’s brewhouse in Philadelphia. And while Thomas Jefferson is often given credit for being a “Founding Homebrewer”, the credit should actually be given to his late wife, Martha, who supervised the majority of the brewing. By the late eighteenth century, women as brewers—and brewing as a household art—was on the decline, giving way to the male-dominated world of the beer industry.</p>

                    <h2 class="text">Modern Female Brewmasters</h2>
                    <p class="text">Today, women are slowly infiltrating the brewing industry. Carol Stoudt of Stoudt’s Brewing Company (founded in 1987) is considered one of the first female brewmasters in the United States. Another female brewmaster, Teri Fahrendorf, founded the Pink Boots Society as a way to empower women beer professionals. In 2008, they had only 22 members and today they have more than a thousand. Women still are not a majority in the beer industry in any capacity. According to a July 2012 Gallup poll, women represent only one-quarter of beer drinkers in America. In the beer industry, women only account for 10% of jobs. For women in charge of breweries, the percentage drops significantly.</p>

                    <h2 class="text">St. Louis Beer Scene</h2>
                    <p class="text">Though the beer industry as a whole is male-dominated, a few local women are carving out a corner of the market, recognizing that drinking, discussing, and brewing beer is not for men alone. The OG: St. Louis Women’s Craft Beer Collective strives to educate its members about craft beer—from tasting to brewing—while supporting women in the industry. The collective holds informational workshops and release parties, and it donates proceeds to other nonprofits, such as Operation Food Search. You’ll find one of the three founders, Abbey Spencer, has further cemented her place in the St. Louis beer scene as the head brewer at Third Wheel Brewing. St. Louis is also home to Anheuser-Busch’s first ever female brewmaster, Natalie Johnson. When asked what she found rewarding about the job, Johnson says, “The most rewarding thing is to see people enjoy what we do.”</p>

                    <p class="text">Next time you pour yourself a nice cold beer, think about all the women who made it possible. The women who spent countless hours brewing their own beer for their families, neighbors, or businesses. The women that have largely been ignored throughout history for all their hard work. As Shakespeare once wrote: </p>
                    <p id="quote">&quot;She brews good ale, and thereof comes the proverb, Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.&quot;</p>
