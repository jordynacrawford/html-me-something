        <h2>Ancient Brewing</h2>
        <p>Womenâ€™s involvement in brewing beer has been documented to at least four-thousand years ago in Mesopotamia, and likely earlier. Ancient Sumerians even had a goddess of beer, Ninkasi. Historically, women were involved in brewing, since it was seen as a domestic task. There were also many taverns owned by women, and thus it is likely they also brewed their own beer.</p>
